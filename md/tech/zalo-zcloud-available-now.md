## Zalo's Monetization Strategy

This paid cloud storage service represents one of several ways Zalo is attempting to generate revenue from its user base. As a free messaging app, Zalo faces the challenge of balancing user experience with the need to create sustainable income streams.

Other potential monetization methods Zalo might be exploring or implementing could include:

1. In-app purchases
2. Advertising
3. Premium features
4. Business services and integrations

By offering cloud storage as a paid service, Zalo aims to provide added value to users while creating a new revenue stream. This approach allows the company to maintain its core messaging service as free while offering optional premium features for users who require additional functionality.

As Zalo continues to evolve its business model, users can expect to see more paid services and features in the future, carefully balanced with the app's free offerings to maintain its widespread popularity in Vietnam.
