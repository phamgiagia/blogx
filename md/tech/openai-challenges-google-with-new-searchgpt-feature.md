# OpenAI Challenges Google with New SearchGPT Feature

OpenAI, the artificial intelligence powerhouse, has unveiled its latest innovation: SearchGPT. This new search feature aims to provide "timely answers" to questions by drawing from web sources, potentially positioning OpenAI as a challenger to established search giants like Google and Bing, as well as AI-powered search startups like Perplexity.

## Key Features of SearchGPT

- User interface similar to ChatGPT
- Provides information and photos from web sources
- Includes links to relevant sources
- Allows for follow-up questions and related searches
- Location-aware for certain types of queries

## Technology and Availability

- Powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o models
- Currently available to a small group of users and publishers
- Waitlist open for interested parties

## Addressing Concerns

OpenAI is taking steps to address common criticisms of AI-powered search tools:

1. **Attribution**: SearchGPT promises clear, in-line, named attribution to publishers
2. **Publisher Collaboration**: Working with publishers to design the user experience
3. **Content Control**: Providing website owners ways to manage how their content appears in search results
4. **Separation from AI Training**: SearchGPT results can include sites that opt out of generative AI training

## Industry Context

The launch of SearchGPT comes at a time when AI-powered search tools are under scrutiny for issues such as:

- Plagiarism
- Inaccuracies
- Content cannibalization
- Potential negative impact on publisher traffic

## Looking Ahead

While OpenAI positions SearchGPT as a more responsible and measured deployment compared to competitors, the company's past practices (such as scraping YouTube transcripts without permission) may raise skepticism. The impact and reception of SearchGPT in the evolving landscape of AI-powered search remain to be seen.

As the search engine market continues to evolve with AI integration, SearchGPT represents a significant move by OpenAI to expand its influence in the digital information space.
