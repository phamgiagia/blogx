# TikTok's New 'Sound Search' Feature Challenges YouTube Music and Shazam

TikTok is rolling out a new feature called "Sound Search," which allows users to find a sound by singing, humming, or playing it. This feature is currently available to select users in certain regions.

## How Sound Search Works

Sound Search on TikTok functions similarly to YouTube Music's song detection tool:

- Users can identify songs by singing, humming, or playing them
- The tool goes beyond Shazam's capabilities, which only works with actual song playback
- TikTok's version not only finds songs but also shows videos using those songs

## Features and Limitations

- The tool seems more effective with popular songs on the app
- It can recognize both songs and TikTok-specific sounds/memes
- Some glitches occur with less popular songs

## How to Access Sound Search

If you have access to the feature:

1. Go to the search bar in the app
2. Click the microphone icon
3. Select "Sound Search"

## Implications for TikTok

- Enhances TikTok's search capabilities
- Aims to keep users within the TikTok ecosystem for song identification
- Reinforces the importance of sounds in driving trends on the platform

The full rollout date for all users is currently unknown.
