# Angular: Empowering Developers to Build Fast, Reliable Web Applications.

Angular, maintained by a dedicated team at Google, is a powerful web framework that provides developers with a comprehensive suite of tools, APIs, and libraries. It offers a solid platform for building scalable, fast, and reliable applications. Let's explore some of the key features that make Angular stand out.

## Features That Power Your Development

### 1. Organized Codebase

Angular's opinionated component model and flexible dependency injection system help keep your codebase well-organized:

- **Components**: Easily split your code into well-encapsulated parts.
- **Dependency Injection**: Maintain modular, loosely-coupled, and testable code.

### 2. Fast State Updates

Angular's fine-grained reactivity model, based on Signals, offers:

- Simplified development
- Faster apps by default
- Granular tracking of state usage throughout the application

### 3. Performance Optimization

Angular supports:

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- Full DOM hydration
- Deferred loading with `@defer` blocks in templates

### 4. First-Party Modules

Angular provides robust first-party modules for:

- Forms
- Routing (with features like route guards and data resolution)
- And more

## Develop Applications Faster

### Angular CLI

The Angular CLI helps you:

- Set up projects quickly
- Build, serve, test, and deploy applications
- Update your app with `ng update`

### Angular DevTools

A browser extension that aids in:

- Debugging
- Analyzing your app
- Inspecting component trees
- Viewing dependency injection trees
- Custom performance profiling

### IDE Integration

Angular's language services power:

- Code completion
- Navigation
- Refactoring
- Real-time diagnostics

## Ship with Confidence

- Verified against Google's internal repository
- Clear support policies and predictable release schedule
- Long Term Support (LTS) for critical security fixes

## Works at Any Scale

- Internationalization support
- Built-in security features
- Fast build pipeline using Vite and ESBuild

## Open-Source First

- Developed openly on GitHub
- Public roadmap and Request for Comments (RFCs)
- Thriving community of developers, writers, and instructors

## Community and Partnerships

- Google Developer Experts (GDEs) for Angular
- Enterprise partnerships
- Collaborations with other Google technologies (Chrome, Firebase, TensorFlow, Flutter, Material Design, Google Cloud)

Angular continues to evolve, focusing on improving developer experience and application performance across the web ecosystem.
